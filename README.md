# Notes
**1️⃣** To make our React code more readable we use JSX and with the help of JSX we create React Elements.

**2️⃣** JSX is javascript syntax to create React Elements.

    const jsxHeading = < h1 id="head" > I am JSX </h2>

**3️⃣** JSX code cannot be understood by JS Engine so our bundler **Parcel** transpiled/convert code before it reaches to the JS Engine. An on the behalf of **Parcel** this work is done by **Babel**.

**4️⃣ Bundler** is a tool that compiles and bundles JavaScript code and its dependencies into a single file (or a few files) for efficient delivery to the browser. 

 Some most commonly used bundlers in React projects are **Webpack**, **Parcel** and **Vite**. 

**5️⃣** There are 2 types of components in React 

    🔸 Class Bases Component -- The older version of writing code
    
    🔸 Functional Components -- The newer version of writing code
